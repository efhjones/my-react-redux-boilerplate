This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I left most of the helpful comments in many of the files.

On top of that, there's just Redux! 

The basic setup of React/Redux has been taken care of. That means you already have a place for dispatchers, action types, reducers, and the store. There's also
a container component connected to the store so you can easily start creating and dispatching actions.

I like to use this as a boilerplate to many of my projects, since it's mostly spare and has some time consuming boilerplate taken care of.

If you want to work with recompose, you can very easily add that to the project. Since there's only one stateless functional component to start off with, it'll be really easy to build with recompose.

To run, clone, `npm install`, and `npm start`.

Since this was bootstrapped with Create React App, I highly recommend taking a look at their [README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) if you have any issues.
